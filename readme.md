# Techvitality Template Generator

## Modular base template that has basic customization

This build system uses Python with Jinja2 to create new custom templates. This allows various parts of the template to be fixed as a base and then basic aspects customized for each store. 

It also allows for faster development of new and different templates since the template is broken up into it's respective parts.
